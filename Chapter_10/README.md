# Persistance
This chapter includes 32 problems that involve Java persistence. These problems have been carefully chosen for helping you to sharpen 
the skills needed for using Java persistence in an efficient way. Java persistence layer is prone to a significant number of performance 
penalties, and this chapter will reveal these problems one by one. From fetching attributes in a lazy manner to open session in view 
anti-pattern, from counting and asserting SQLs to best techniques for mapping associations, we will give a lot of attention to the 
performance of the persistent layer. The applications are developed using Spring Boot 2, Hibernate 5 and MySQL 8.
